# Flight Price Prediction: End-to-End Machine Learning Project using AWS Sagemaker

## Overview
This project predicts flight prices using machine learning. It includes data processing, model training with AWS SageMaker, and a deployed Streamlit web application.

## Notebooks Description
- EDA.ipynb: Exploratory data analysis
- data-cleaning.ipynb: Data preprocessing
- feature_engineering.ipynb: Feature creation
- model-training.ipynb: Model development

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the Application
streamlit run app.py

## AWS SageMaker Details
- Instance: ml.m5.xlarge
- Algorithm: XGBoost
- Training Time: 3 minutes
- Accuracy: 84.32%
